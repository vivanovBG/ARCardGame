# ARCardGame
AR Card game with numerous basic functionalities

Project Overview
This project is an augmented-reality (AR) board game that recognises three distinct cards.
When one of these cards is presented to the camera, the game can summon the corresponding 3-D character model—or withdraw it if the card is removed.

Once on the board, each character can be placed in Attack Mode or Defence Mode via user commands.

Key Features
Card Recognition – Robust computer-vision routines identify exactly which of the three cards is in view.

Dynamic Character Control – Summon or withdraw a hero in real time; switch seamlessly between attack and defence states.

Tailored Animations & VFX – Every hero comes with bespoke animations and special effects for each action:

Wizard – performs sweeping, circular arm motions while casting spells.

Knight – engages foes with melee weapons and shield blocks.

…and so on for additional heroes.

These effects are fine-tuned to reflect the unique abilities and fighting styles of each character, creating an engaging and immersive AR experience.
